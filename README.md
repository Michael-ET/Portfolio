# Portfolio


This is a HTML portfolio website made to advertise and link to my various projects. It also uses Javascript and CSS. 
The base code for this site was sourced from HTML5 as a free download and then repurposed. I added in links to my 
projects/socials, relevant images and made styling changes that fitted the blue theme.
