							<h4>The Planning Inspectorate (Civil Service): 2022 - Present</h4>
							<br>
							<p id="projectsContent">
								 During my time with PINS I have moved from EO (junior) to HEO (mid-level). In my current role I contribute to the development and maintenance of web applications and internal tools that support critical business functions such as case tracking, planning application and appeal management, document sharing, peer review, and templating. Working within an agile delivery team, I help manage feature builds and bug fixes, refine and estimate tickets, write robust automated tests, and support sprint planning and roadmap discussions. Alongside this I also support the wider team with mentoring and managing junior developers.

								<h2>Technical Capabilities</h2>
							</header>
							<p id="projectsContent">
								Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a strong and adaptable technical skillset, working confidently across both frontend and backend environments. My expertise includes modern frameworks such as <b>Vue</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Nunjucks</b>, along with backend technologies like <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Prisma</b>, and <b>MSSQL</b>. I design and document APIs using <b>Swagger</b>, and apply <b>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</b> to write maintainable, reliable code. My daily workflow involves tools like <b>Docker</b>, <b>WebStorm</b>, <b>Postman</b>, <b>GitHub</b>, and <b>Azure DevOps</b>, within <b>agile</b> teams using <b>Jira</b> for sprint planning and task management. I also regularly use <b>GitHub Copilot</b> to automate repetitive tasks and accelerate development. On the frontend, I work with <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>, always aiming to follow modern coding standards and best practices. In a professional setting, I contribute to feature development, collaborate with stakeholders, and support the continuous improvement and maintenance of production applications.
								<br><br>
								Pictured below are utilizations of these tools in the context of my previous work. My tech stack is continually growing to adapt to new projects and goals. <b>Click on an image for more details on my experience with each tool or capability</b>.

											<div class="overlay" id="techStackText1"><p>During my time as lead developer on Checkmark I was responsible for planning and executing a large scale refactor of the codebase. This involved redesigning the application architecture to improve performance, maintainability, and scalability. I created a detailed project plan, breaking down the refactor into manageable tasks and setting milestones to track progress. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to ensure the refactor aligned with business needs and technical requirements. Prior to my move to a new team I designed extensive documentation to detail progress and guide junior developers on how to move forward with the project.<br></br>
											Working as a contributing developer to the appeals back office portal I worked within an agile team to expand the project which was built using a unique style of Nunjucks mapping architecture. This involved working alongside a large team of developers to build new features, solve complex bugs and optimize performance. </p></div>

								<h3>The code...</h3>			
								<p id='aboutMeContent' >
									<br>
									I began my journey in code as a university student being introduced to C#. As a 
									 unique tools for audio triggering & manipulation.  
									During this time I had my first taste of the potential to express myself creatively whilst building tools that offer new possibilities to the user. 
									At this stage, however, I lacked the foundational knowledge to understand languages and the theory behind it. Never the less, this experience instilled a 
									curiosity of coding technology that would come to define my goals for the future.
									<br>
									<br>
									My journey continued later in life as I commited to exploring code further. Since October 2020 I became a practicing developer, self-teaching through 
									online and bootcamp recources. During this time I built foundational knowledge and explored the further possibilities of web development. This period
									of learning culminated in my hiring as an EO developer with the Planning Inspectorate in 2022.
									<br>
									<br>
									This journey has since progressed into a mid-level developer role, where I now contribute more strategically to application development. I work across the full development lifecycleâ€”planning, building, testing, and maintaining features used in public systems. With stronger technical foundations and growing experience, Iâ€™ve taken on more responsibility, grown confident handling complex challenges and even passed my experience on with mentoring. This stage of my career has allowed me to deepen my skills while making meaningful contributions to larger, more complex projects.
								</p>
								<h3>The person...</h3>
								<p id='aboutMeContent'>
									<br>
									At the core I am a technical and creative person. I have an eye for detail in aesthetics and a passion for visionary design. As a computer musician & 
									developer I enjoy working on complex projects (often on a collaborative basis with peers). My temperament is friendly, engaging and optimistic. I am 
									outgoing and enjoy building strong social bonds. My interests include art, history, literature, movies, gaming, cooking and more.
									<br>
									<br>
									I have a varied employment history and throughout it I've learnt how to perform effectively in many different capacities. My previous roles include, 
									quality assurance, data analysis, administration, sales, FOH/reception, customer service and more. 
									<br>
